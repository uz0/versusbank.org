Weakest Link: External documentation research (CL2). R_raw: 3/4. Congruence Penalty: 0.5 (not directly tested in this context). R_eff: 2.5/4. Bias Check: Low bias - relies on official Vite/React documentation. Primary risks: Build complexity may be underestimated; bundle size impact on performance needs validation; PWA features may add complexity not evidenced in research.
