Weakest Link: Internal functional prototype provides maximum confidence (CL3). R_raw: 4/4. Congruence Penalty: 0 (tested in target context). R_eff: 4/4. Bias Check: Low bias - evidence directly validates architecture without external dependencies. Primary risk: Implementation complexity may be underestimated, but core technical feasibility proven.
